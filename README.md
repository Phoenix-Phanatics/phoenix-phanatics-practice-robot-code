# How it works

The following code is a simple MAXSwerve drivetrain made with NEO Brushless motors v1.1, NEO 550's, and SPARK MAX's in Java with the help of WPILib. The program is deployed to the practice robot we were lent and allows for swerve driving operations, turning in place, and a defensive x shaped wheel maneuver.
